# Work Day Scheduler

## Your Task
> * My task here was to create a scheduler that could be used day to day to plan out a work day.

## Instructions to use
> * There are no download requirements or file needed. Simply head to the webpage and begin using it. It can be saved to a mobile to be used similiar to an application simply by pressing the share button and then scroll down and click add to homescreen.

## ScreenShot and URL

### Learning experience gained
> * I have really gotten a better grasp on using jquery by doing this and I have also come to realize what the data attribute does/how it is used. I also came to realize how to better do my readme.md file.
